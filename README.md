# FetchTMDBtoSheets
Apps script to fetch tv show data to a google sheet
The idea is that you gather the tmdb-ids for all your favorite tv-series in a google sheet, then you run the script wich will fetch info of your tvshows to see if there is anything new that youÂ´ve missed.

for each row the script will fetch: 
- release date of first episode 
- release date of last episode 
- episode number of last episode

How to use:
- Get an API-key at https://www.themoviedb.org/
- Make a new google sheet and make a new Add-ons/Apps Script
- Paste the function in script.js and insert your API-key
